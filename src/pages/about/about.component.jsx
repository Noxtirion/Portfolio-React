            My name is Dariusz Bartyzel. I have studied Finance and Accounting in University of
            Economics in Cracow. After a few years of working in this profession I came to
            conclusion that I lack satisfaction from my current specialization. Wondering what path
            should I take next, suddenly an opportunity occurred to create my first website. It
            turned out to be so fascinating that resulted in decision to change my future career
            path. Now is the time when I would like to accelerate my development by working in a
            real environment, because no sources of learning can replace it. Despite of lack
            experience I would like to find a place where I can get the knowledge and push forward
            my skills as a Front-end Developer.
